# multi-output-glucose-forecasting
The code and data used for the paper Deep Multi-Output Forecasting: Learning to Accurately Predict Blood Glucose Trajectories published in KDD 2018. The full paper is available on arxiv: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05357.pdf

By downloading and using these data you agree to comply with the following:

   - You will no attempt re-identification;
   - You will contact The University of Michigan (UM) if identifiers are detected;
   - You will not redistribute or resell the data;
   - Data ownership remains with UM
   - Requirements survive changes in ownership of entity

Update: this repo was originally intented to serve as the starting point for a full and clean version of the code I used (since my research code was...researchy). Since it's been years and I never got around to actually doing it here's the full research version in all of it's messiness: https://gitlab.eecs.umich.edu/mld3/glucose_forecasting
